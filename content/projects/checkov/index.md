Checkov is a to-do list app written completely in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Users can create a to-do list and add, edit (on double-click), and delete individual tasks on their list. It also persists the user's to-do list across sessions using the browser's local storage.

This was one of my first projects as a new developer—at the time, I had only three weeks of experience learning programming basics and JavaScript syntax. The app was built in the course of four days on a team of four peers (complete beginners).

There were several constraints/requirements given to my team for this project:

- No 3rd-party frameworks or libraries—only pure JavaScript for all logic and DOM manipulation
- Roughly follow some agile software programming practices (pair programming, [user stories](https://github.com/abc-s/201-final-project/blob/master/planning/user-stories.md), [workflow organization](https://github.com/abc-s/201-final-project/projects/1), etc.)
- Thoroughly plan and document the architecture of our application ([planning docs](https://github.com/abc-s/201-final-project/tree/master/planning))
- Begin work Monday and complete all work Thursday (of the same week)
- Give a project presentation that Friday ([slides](https://github.com/abc-s/201-final-project/blob/master/planning/presentation-slideshow.pdf))

It's always fun looking back and laughing at old work. There's *plenty* I'd do differently now, but I'm proud of what this small app represents in my journey as a developer.
