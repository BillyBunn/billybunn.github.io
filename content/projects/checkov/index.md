Chekov is a web app that allows users to create a to-do list and add, edit, and delete individual tasks on their list. It also persists the user's to-do list across browser sessions using the browser's local storage.

The app was built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript following responsive design principles. It is deployed on GitHub Pages [here](https://abc-s.github.io/201-final-project).
