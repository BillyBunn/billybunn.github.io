- **Languages**: JavaScript, SQL
- **Libraries and frameworks**: Node.js, Express, jQuery, Chart.js, Moment.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Deployment platform**: Heroku
- **3rd-Party APIs**: [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/)

See it deployed at [hindsite.trade](http://hindsite.trade/).
