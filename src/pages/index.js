      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Right out of high school, I moved from Northern California to Seattle. I
        spent several years working in online retail, copywriting, and
        bookkeeping while getting my BA in accounting from the University of
        Washington. After graduating, I went straight to work for an
        international accounting firm as a financial statement auditor. There, I
        worked on client teams to serve middle-market companies in a number of
        industries. In late 2018, I left the finance world to pursue my passion
        and study coding full-time.
