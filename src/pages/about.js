    <h3>Hello</h3>
    <p>
      I'm a software developer and former public accountant. My experience in
      finance informs my perspective developing software for clients while
      keeping the users' experienced at the forefront.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have experience making full-stack applications with several modern tools
      and libraries. I've built things with React, Node, Express, MongoDB, and
      more. You can see some of my work <Link to="/work">here</Link>.
    </p>

    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
      Right out of high school, I moved from my small town in Northern
      California up to Seattle. There, I worked in online retail, copywriting,
      and bookkeeping while earning my B.A. in Accounting from the{" "}
      <a href="https://www.uwb.edu/">University of Washington Bothell</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      After graduating, I landed a job that gave me experience working
      face-to-face with clients and an inside-look at how large businesses are
      operated—I was a financial statement auditor at an international
      accounting firm and on the road to earning my CPA credential.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoyed working on small teams to serve clients and their
      users/customers, but I realized that my coding hobby was more suited for
      my passions—building solutions to people's problems and constant learning.
    </p>

    <h3>Finance to Software</h3>
    <p>
      In late 2018, I took a leap and left the finance world to study coding and
      develop software full-time. I attended an intensive 20 week software
      development bootcamp in Seattle called{" "}
      <a href="https://www.codefellows.org/">Code Fellows</a>, where I studied
      and built full-stack applications 70+ hours a week. I specialized in
      full-stack JavaScript, but—more importantly—learned how to learn anything
      at a rapid pace and implement it in a working product.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since graduating from Code Fellows, I've continued to code everyday while
      working as a private tutor. I teach students one-on-one in the basics of
      programming and more advanced features of JavaScript.
