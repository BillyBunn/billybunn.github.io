It allows users to create multiple to-do lists and add, edit, and delete tasks on each list. Data is persisted across browser sessions using local storage.</p>\n<p>The application is written using only JavaScript, HTML, and CSS—no outside libraries, frameworks, or languages are used.</p>\n<p>This version of the application was designed with a Model-View-Controller pattern.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">model.js</code> defines the shape of the persisted list and task data stored in local storage. It uses the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage\"><code class=\"language-text\">Window.localstorage</code></a> API to fetch/save data.</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">view.js</code> displays the current Model data to the user. It renders all the dynamic DOM elements to the page, sets up all the event listeners, and passes functions from <code class=\"language-text\">controller.js</code> to handle events where a change in the view or model needs to take place.</li>\n<li>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">controller.js</code> receives user input (through DOM event handlers) which update the Model and View. To achieve this, the Controller takes an instance of a Model and View in its class constructor and calls the appropriate methods of each, depending on the user interaction.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An interesting piece of this app: to respond to events on the page, the Controller passes its class methods <em>into</em> View class’s methods. To keep the Controller’s methods bound to the appropriate <code class=\"language-text\">this</code>, the <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind\"><code class=\"language-text\">bind()</code></a> method is used when they’re passed in as parameters. See this in <a href=\"https://github.com/BillyBunn/chekov/blob/master/js/controller.js\">the class constructor in <code class=\"language-text\">controller.js</code></a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">app.js</code> serves as the entry point, where instances of the Model, View, and Controller are created and the application is started.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://billybunn.com/chekov/\">See it deployed on GitHub pages</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Original Project</h3>\n<p>This repository is a fork of a final course project at a coding bootcamp, <a href=\"https://www.codefellows.org/\">Code Fellows</a>’ <em>Code 201</em> course. The original project was created by 4 junior developers (with only 3 weeks of programming experience) in four days.</p>\n<p>This fork is a re-working of the original project by <a href=\"https://github.com/BillyBunn\">Billy Bunn</a>, started and completed approximately four months later.</p>\n<h4>Original Team Credits</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/sabdi21\">Shukri Abdi</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/BillyBunn\">Billy Bunn</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/amjcurtis\">Andrew Curtis</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/cory0s\">Cory Henderson</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This was one of my first projects as a new developer—at the time, I had only three weeks of experience learning programming basics and JavaScript syntax. The app was built in the course of four days on a team of four peers (complete beginners).</p>\n<p>There were several constraints/requirements given to my team for the original project:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No 3rd-party frameworks or libraries—only pure JavaScript for all logic and DOM manipulation</li>\n<li>Roughly follow some agile software programming practices (pair programming, <a href=\"https://github.com/abc-s/201-final-project/blob/master/planning/user-stories.md\">user stories</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/abc-s/201-final-project/projects/1\">workflow organization</a>, etc.)</li>\n<li>Thoroughly plan and document the architecture of our application (<a href=\"https://github.com/abc-s/201-final-project/tree/master/planning\">planning docs</a>)</li>\n<li>Begin work Monday and complete all work Thursday (of the same week)</li>\n<li>Give a project presentation that Friday (<a href=\"https://github.com/abc-s/201-final-project/blob/master/planning/presentation-slideshow.pdf\">slides</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s always fun looking back and laughing at old work, but I’m proud of what this small app represents in my journey as a developer.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/abc-s/201-final-project\">See the repository for the original on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<!-- ![checkov initial screen](./checkov-1.png)\n![checkov list screen](./checkov-2.png) -->","frontmatter":{"title":"Checkov","date":"February 01, 2019","description":"A to-do list app in pure, vanilla JavaScript.","source":"https://github.com/BillyBunn/chekov","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"originalImg":"/static/27127996d37f824316e6178d61921288/6eaa4/checkov-logo.png"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/checkov/","collection":"projects","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/curve/","collection":"projects","path":"projects/curve/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Curve"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/hindsite-trader/","collection":"projects","path":"projects/hindsite-trader/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"HindSite Trader"}}}}}
