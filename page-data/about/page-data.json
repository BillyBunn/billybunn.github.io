You can\nsee some of my work <a href=\"../projects\">here</a>. I'm also a private\ntutor at <a href=\"https://www.codefellows.org/\">Code Fellows</a>.</p>\n<p>Previously, I was a financial statement auditor for an international\naccounting firm. I worked face-to-face with clients in middle-market\ncompanies to audit their financial statements and processes. I made a\ncareer change to software when I realized coding was much more suited to\nmy passion for solving users problems and my interest in new technologies.\nRead more about that below.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Available for Hire</h3>\n<p>I'm currently seeking a full-time software development role with a team in\nthe greater Seattle, WA area. If you're hiring or just want to grab some\ncoffee, reach out to me on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/billybunn/\">LinkedIn</a> or <a href=\"mailto:billy@billybunn.com?subject=Inquiry from BillyBunn.com\"> shoot me an email</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Background</h3>\n<p>Right out of high school, I moved from my small town in Northern\nCalifornia up to Seattle. There, I worked in online retail, copywriting,\nand bookkeeping while earning my B.A. in Accounting from the <a href=\"https://www.uwb.edu/\">University of Washington Bothell</a>.</p>\n<p>After graduating, I landed a job that gave me experience working\nface-to-face with clients and an inside-look at how large businesses are\noperated—I was a financial statement auditor at an international\naccounting firm and on the road to earning my CPA credential.</p>\n<p>I enjoyed working on small teams to serve clients and their\nusers/customers, but I realized that my coding hobby was more suited for\nmy passions—building solutions to people's problems and constant learning.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>The Transition to Coding</h3>\n<p>In late 2018, I took a leap and left the finance world to study coding and\ndevelop software full-time. I attended an intensive 20 week software\ndevelopment bootcamp in Seattle called <a href=\"https://www.codefellows.org/\">Code Fellows</a>, where I studied and built full-stack applications 70+ hours a week. I specialized in a\nmodern JavaScript stack, but—more importantly—learned how to absorb\ndocumentation quickly, meet rapid deadlines, and get working results out\nthe door.</p>\n<p>Since graduating from Code Fellows, I've continued to code everyday while\nworking as a private tutor. I teach students one-on-one in the basics of\nprogramming and more advanced features of JavaScript.</p>"}}},"headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/5c46317364e92ae9591d48df6982bb9e/913d3/headshot.jpg","srcSet":"/static/5c46317364e92ae9591d48df6982bb9e/b0f04/headshot.jpg 125w,\n/static/5c46317364e92ae9591d48df6982bb9e/5700d/headshot.jpg 250w,\n/static/5c46317364e92ae9591d48df6982bb9e/913d3/headshot.jpg 500w,\n/static/5c46317364e92ae9591d48df6982bb9e/5059d/headshot.jpg 750w,\n/static/5c46317364e92ae9591d48df6982bb9e/6b237/headshot.jpg 1000w,\n/static/5c46317364e92ae9591d48df6982bb9e/1a798/headshot.jpg 1024w","srcWebp":"/static/5c46317364e92ae9591d48df6982bb9e/88b22/headshot.webp","srcSetWebp":"/static/5c46317364e92ae9591d48df6982bb9e/e0bb9/headshot.webp 125w,\n/static/5c46317364e92ae9591d48df6982bb9e/23cf0/headshot.webp 250w,\n/static/5c46317364e92ae9591d48df6982bb9e/88b22/headshot.webp 500w,\n/static/5c46317364e92ae9591d48df6982bb9e/34303/headshot.webp 750w,\n/static/5c46317364e92ae9591d48df6982bb9e/152af/headshot.webp 1000w,\n/static/5c46317364e92ae9591d48df6982bb9e/23721/headshot.webp 1024w","sizes":"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":true}}}
